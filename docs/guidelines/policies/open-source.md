# Open Source-policy
## Bruk av open source
Klargjør at teamet aktivt bruker åpen kildekode (som React, etc.) og at dette skjer i tråd med lisenser. Oppfordre utviklere til å sjekke lisens på nye biblioteker de vil ta inn. F.eks.: "Foretrekk permissive lisenser (MIT, Apache 2.0). Unngå GPL-lisensierte komponenter i produkter der det kan tvinge oss til åpen kildekode for hele prosjektet." Hvis bedriften har et verktøy for lisensscanning, nevnes det.

## Bidrag tilbake
Oppmuntre til å bidra til open source-prosjekter dere bruker, dersom man fikser en bug eller lager en relevant forbedring. Beskriv prosessen for dette kort: "Clearing fra teknisk leder kreves før kode bidras tilbake i arbeidstiden, for å sikre at det ikke avslører sensitiv informasjon." Mange firmaer har regler for at utviklere kan bidra på fritid, men at bidrag i arbeidstid må godkjennes.

## Egne open source-prosjekter
Om teamet planlegger å åpne kildekoden til deler av systemet eller bibliotek de lager, angi retningslinjer. F.eks. "All open source-utgivelse må godkjennes av legal/ledelse. Vi publiserer på GitHub under Apache 2.0 med en CONTRIBUTING.md for eksterne bidrag." Dette kan være relevant om dere lager et generisk bibliotek eller verktøy i løpet av arbeidet.

## Bruk av andres kode
Angi at selv om Stack Overflow og GitHub gists er fristende kilder, skal man være oppmerksom på lisens. En tommelfingerregel: kopier man mer enn noen få linjer kode direkte, bør man ha lov (f.eks. hvis det er fra en MIT-lisens repo, legg inn attributt i kommentar eller dokumentasjon om nødvendig).

## Oppdateringer og ansvar
Noter at når man inkluderer open source, følger ansvar med: hold komponentene oppdatert (jfr. sikkerhet), og følg med på de repositoriene for viktige endringer.
